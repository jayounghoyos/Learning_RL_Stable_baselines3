# Reinforcement Learning Course

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for a practical course on **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. The course is structured to provide hands-on experience with RL concepts, algorithms, and projects, focusing on widely used libraries such as **Stable-Baselines3** and **Gymnasium**.

### Objectives
- Understand the core concepts of Reinforcement Learning.
- Implement and train RL agents in various environments.
- Explore advanced algorithms like **PPO** and **DQN**.
- Apply RL to real-world-inspired projects.
